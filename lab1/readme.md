# Lab 1: Electronics Basics

## Intro

In this first lab, we will be exploring the links between voltage, current, and resistance. This lab
will be the most theoretical of them all, but is very important in understanding how the rest of the
projects work, so hang with it!

## Requirements

- An LED
- A pushbutton
- A 1000 Ohm Resistor
- A potentiometer

## Do It

### Voltage, Current, Resistance

Ohm's Law: The most important equation in electronics.
- Ohm's Law
- 3 Problems
- 3 Word Problems
  - 1.5 volt AA battery with a

### Resistors

- Resistors in Series
- Resistors in Parallel
- Voltage Divider

### Power

- P = IV
- Use a multimeter to measure voltage across a resistor, use that to see how much power that res. uses.

### The LED

- Voltage Drop

### The Pushbutton

Two Diagrams - one where the signal is HIGH and one where it is LOW

### The Potentiometer

Final lab: LED + resistor + potentiometer + voltage
